            After many months of research we can say, without doubt, that Melinda Briggs has been found to be stinky.  It's true and many find it hard to believe that 
            it's taken so long to gain inconclusive proof.  <i>"foetidus soror"</i> syndrome, the condition of bad-smelling younger siblings, has been known for centuries 
            but it was thought to have been erradicated in the early 1940s.  Several cases of foul-smelling siblings have been identfied since but the case of 
            Melinda Briggs appears to be the most noxious.  Speaking at The 19th International Conference for Odors, Chandler Burr claimed that this is the worse case 
            he's ever encountered.</p>
            <p>Representatives of Melinda Briggs stated that she is not as stinky as everyone claims, but she's just not as good-looking as her brother.</p>
